  Normalize Contact Matrices with BNBC
}
\description{
  Applies BNBC method to normalize contact matrices.
}
\usage{bnbc(cg, batch, threshold=NULL, step=NULL,
                  downSample=FALSE, qn=TRUE, Harmony=FALSE, vars_use = c('Batch'), 
                  scalePCA=TRUE, theta=c(2), lambda=c(1), ComBat=FALSE, nbands=NULL, mod=NULL,
                  mean.only=FALSE, tol=5, bstart=1, verbose = TRUE)}

\arguments{
  \item{cg}{A ContactGroup object.}
  \item{batch}{A single batch indicator variable.}
  \item{threshold}{The maximum distance interacting loci are allowed to
    be separated by.}
  \item{step}{The step size, or the number of bases a contact matrix
    cell represents.}
  \item{downSample}{Whether to apply downsample on each band matrix to 
  maintain the same sequencing depth. Defaults to FALSE.}
  \item{qn}{Whether to apply quantile normalization on each band matrix.
    Defaults to TRUE.}
  \item{Harmony}{Whether to apply harmony on each band matrix.
    Defaults to FALSE.}
  \item{vars_use}{Vector of vars to apply harmony on.
    Defaults to c('Batch').}
  \item{scalePCA}{Whether to scale when doing PCA.
    Defaults to FALSE.}
  \item{theta}{Vector of theta (diversity) to for each var.
    Larger values of theta result in more diverse clusters. Defaults to c(2).}
  \item{lambda}{Vector of lambda (ridge regression penalty) to for each var.
    Smaller values result in more aggressive correction. Defaults to c(1).}
  \item{ComBat}{Whether to apply ComBat on each band matrix.
    Defaults to FALSE.}
  \item{bstart}{The first band to normalize. Defaults to 1.}
  \item{nbands}{The last band to normalize. Defaults to \code{nrow(cg) -
      1}.}
  \item{mod}{A model matrix specifying which sample information is to be
    preserved by ComBat.  Optional.}
  \item{mean.only}{Whether ComBat should not correct for batch effect in the
    variances of band matrix rows. Defaults to FALSE, which means
    variances are corrected.  Set to TRUE if there is only one observation
    per batch.}
  \item{tol}{The number of significant digits for which the mean value
    of a band matrix must be greater than 0 to be processed by ComBat.}
  \item{verbose}{Should the function print progress?}
}

\value{
  A ContactGroup object for which matrix bands \code{bstart:nbands} have
  had BNBC applied.
}

\details{
  Normalization and batch correction is performed in a band-wise manner,
  correcting all samples' observations of one matrix off-diagonal (which
  we refer to as a matrix "band") at a time.  For each matrix band, we
  collect all samples' observations into a single matrix.  We then
  apply quantile normalization to ensure distributional similarity
  across samples.  Finally, we perform batch effect correction using
  ComBat on this matrix.  Each samples' matrix band is then replaced
  with its corrected version. We refer to this process of Band-Wise
  Normalization and Batch Correction as BNBC.  
  
  This function applies BNBC to the set of contact matrices and returns
  a ContactGroup object with matrix bands \code{bstart:nbands}
  corrected.  For those rows in the matrix bands  which cannot be
  corrected we set all elements to 0.

  Very high bands contain little data in Hi-C experiments, and we don't
  recommend to analyze those or apply this function to high bands, see
  the \code{nbands} argument to the function.
  
  We recommend performing bnbc on contact matrices which have been
  converted to log-CPM and smoothed, see the example.
